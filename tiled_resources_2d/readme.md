Tiled Resources for Tier1 Hardware to show how UpdateTiles, UpdateTileMappings are used.

This example renders 16384x16384 rgba texture with 7 mip levels.

It is illustrative example based on the tiled resources example from Microsoft.
However the original example has somewhat more functionality that is note needed sometimes.
So we simplify it a little bit. Instead of Cube Tiled Resource, we use 2d map.
Tested on NVidia 650TI Boost, NVidia 970 and AMD R280X.
